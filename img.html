                The Nicobar Pigeon is one of the most beautiful of the many species of pigeons or doves and is
                the only
                living member of
                the genus Caloenus. It is found in the Islands of Nicobar, south west peninsular Thailand, Malaysia,
                Vietnam, Indonesia,
                Philippines, Solomans and palau. Once known to be found in abundance in its range, their numbers in the
                wild
                are
                declining as they are frequently captured for pet trade and hunted for food.

                Slightly larger than other pigeons at 40 cm, it has a dark slaty grey body with lustrous metallic
                blue-green
                and
                copper-bronze upperparts. It can easily be distinguished by its glistening mane-like neck hackles and
                sharply
                contrasting white tail coverts and tail. Females are smaller in size than males with shorter neck
                hackles
                and brown
                under parts. Youngs are born dull grey without the neck hackles and a bronzy green tail instead of
                white.
